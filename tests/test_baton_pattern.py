"""Pure-QUIC baton-pattern stress test.

Mirrors the WebTransport wt_baton interop scenario at the QUIC layer:
a 1-byte counter is passed back and forth, alternating between
unidirectional and bidirectional streams. Termination occurs when
the counter wraps to 0.

Exercises stream multiplexing, FIN handling, and parallel UNI/BIDI
patterns the same way wt_baton does — useful even though
aiopquic also ships a real WebTransport stack now (see
aiopquic.asyncio.webtransport): this test is independent of H3 so
regressions in the QUIC transport layer surface here without a WT
session in the loop.

For a faithful WebTransport wt_baton interop test, layer it on top of
the WT API (the picohttp reference implementation is at
third_party/picoquic/picohttp/wt_baton.c).
